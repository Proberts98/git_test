I have just added some new text. I am currenlty listening to the sam harris podcast. 
I will recieve my bachelors degree in 2025, my masters degree in 2027 and possibly my phd in 2031.
I will complete the Applied Visual Design Section of the Responsive Web Design certification of freeCodeCamp. Then I will review the two previous sections.

The date today is June 8th 2021.
By the end of June 9th I will complete all the sections of the Responsive Web Design course except for the projects. The projects I will complete by the end of June 13th. That is all I have to say for today. 

So that didn't happen however I am nearly complete the Responsive Web Design Section. By the end of June 10th, 2021 I will have completed the course sections. By June 13th I will complete all of the projects. So I will complete the entire section by June 13th. That is the Responsive Web Design Section of Codecademy.
