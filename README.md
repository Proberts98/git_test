This is Prince's first git project!
I just added some new information, I hope that during my masters degree I come up with a SAAS product that combines my knowledge of machine learning with the back end side of web development.
Today I woke up super late I will try to wake up at 8am tomorrow and be alot more productive. Despite this fact I am still able to make a fair amount of progress in the Web design Certification of FreeCodeCamp. If I keep up my current pace I should have The Web Design Certification earned by June 14th, 2021. So that will be my goal.
